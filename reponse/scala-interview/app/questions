1) Explain REST and RESTful
REST (representational state transfer) is a style of software architecture defining a set of constraints to be used to create web services.
REST architecture style web services, also known as RESTful web services, establish interoperability between computers on the Internet.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
The architectural style for the creation of a web API is use URI (knowing the URI to name and identifying a resource), use HTTP 
(provides all the necessary operations : GET, POST, PUT and DELETE), and use HTML or XML or JSON.

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)


4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
A stateless protocol is a communication protocol which does not record the state of a communication session between two successive requests, 
contrary to the stateful protocol which does the record of information about the internal state of the server. 
And the stateless protocol is HTTP.

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
Get is visible to the user in the address field, but in the case of a POST, it's not visible for the user.
With GET, all information the user will enter are transmitted freely and without data protection, 
but not in the case of a POST which will keeps confidentiality.

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
If I have difficulty with a code, I'll first try again, sometimes when I draw each step or reread my code from the beginning, it help.
I'll try to find on the net if anyone have the same problem.
And I will try to find someone to exchange ideas to resolve the problem, sometimes two head are better than one.
